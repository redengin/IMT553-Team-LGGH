This is a coordination point for our IMT553 project.

We will be analyzing firewall logs, the wikipedia corpus, and other data sources in order to identify correlations supporting our hypothesis.

Methodology for analysis:
  * each output shall retain a mapping to the original data input
      * For example, an extract of IPs from a firewall log would retain the line numbers for each occurance of an IP
